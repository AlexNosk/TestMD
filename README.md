# .NET API for Various Document Formats

[Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) is a Document Processing library that allows developers to work with documents in many popular formats without needing Office Automation. Users can perform a wide variety of document tasks, ranging from simply converting documents from one supported format to another and modifying these documents during the conversion process, to business-oriented tasks, such as creating structured and visually appealing documents or automating reporting with complex templates and data-bound fields.

## Documentation
Aspose.Words is a powerful on-premise class library that can be used for numerous document processing tasks.
