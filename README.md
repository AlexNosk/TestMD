Aspose.Words is a powerful on-premise class library that can be used for numerous document processing tasks. It enables developers to enhance their own applications with features such as generating, modifying, converting, rendering, and printing documents, without relying on third-party applications, for example, Microsoft Word, or automation.

The following are some popular features of Aspose.Words for .NET:
